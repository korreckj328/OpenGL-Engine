# OpenGL-Engine
An OpenGL engine written for educational purposes.

This engine is being written as I enjoyed my Class assignment of working on a DirectX engine to learn the basics of the
rendering pipeline.

Because I mostly use an old mac with a non-metal gpu at the moment,  I decided to work on an OpenGL Engine to keep 
learning about how to setup a Game Engine.
